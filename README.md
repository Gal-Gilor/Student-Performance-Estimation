# Student Performance

Have you ever wondered what affects students' grades the most?
Although every person has their strengths, are there external factors that distinguish students who excel from those that do not?

Well. I have! In this project, I'm exploring the [Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) to find what contributes to our success in school and what hinders it.

However, sadly, I can only speculate why some factors affect the way they do. Moreover, what's true for this sample of students (396 students from two high schools in Portugal), might not hold for the entire population.
